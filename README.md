# wokwi-cli


Wokwi Simulation API command line interface.

## Installation

Download the latest release from the [GitHub Releases page](https://github.com/wokwi/wokwi-cli/releases/latest). Rename the file to `wokwi-cli` (or `wokwi-cli.exe` on Windows), and put it in your `PATH`.

On Linux and macOS, you can also install the CLI using the following command:

```bash
curl -L https://wokwi.com/ci/install.sh | sh
```

And on Windows:

```powershell
iwr https://wokwi.com/ci/install.ps1 -useb | iex
```

## Usage

First, ensure that you set the `WOKWI_CLI_TOKEN` environment variable to your Wokwi API token. You can get your token from your [Wokwi CI Dashboard](https://wokwi.com/dashboard/ci).

```
wokwi-cli [directory]
```

The given directory should have a `wokwi.toml` file, as explained in [the documentation](https://docs.wokwi.com/vscode/project-config#wokwitoml).

For example, you could clone the [ESP32 Hello World binaries repo](https://github.com/wokwi/esp-idf-hello-world), and point the CLI at the `esp-idf-hello-world` directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/wokwi/esp-idf-hello-world
cd esp-idf-hello-world
wokwi-cli .
```

## Configuration Wizard

To generate a `wokwi.toml` and a default `diagram.json` files for your project, run:

```bash
wokwi-cli init
```

This will ask you a few questions and will create the necessary files in the current directory. If you want to create the files in a different directory, pass the directory name as an argument:

```bash
wokwi-cli init my-project
```

## MCP Server

The MCP server is an experimental feature that allows you to use the Wokwi CLI as a MCP server. You can use it to integrate the Wokwi CLI with AI agents.

To configure your AI agent to use the MCP server, add the following to your agent's configuration:

```json
{
  "servers": {
    "Wokwi": {
      "type": "stdio",
      "command": "wokwi-cli",
      "args": ["mcp"],
      "env": {
        "WOKWI_CLI_TOKEN": "${input:wokwi-cli-token}"
      }
    }
  }
}
```


## Development

Clone the repository, install the npm depenedencies, and then run the CLI:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/wokwi/wokwi-cli
cd wokwi-cli
npm install
npm start
```

To pass command line arguments to the cli, use `npm start -- [arguments]`. For example, to see the help screen, run:

```
npm start -- -h
```
